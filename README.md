# AndroidAssocDevPrep
These are a few Android apps I worked with to help me prepare for the Android Associate Developer Certification!

DataPersistence: An app heavily based on a Lynda course about Data Persistence using Room

JobScheduler: An app that uses the JobService class to schedule a job when certain conditions are met( phone connected to the internet and also to power source)

MiniFeatures: An App that shows different versions of how Snackbar can be implemented

MyLiveData: A cool app that uses ButterKnife, Room and LiveData to start a process in the background thread that saves random numbers at every 10-second interval into the database. These changes are automatically reflected on the UI.

PagingLibrary: Contains the Paging Library Architecture component that works with Recycler View

TestingApp: A calculator App that uses Room, LiveData and Recycler View.
